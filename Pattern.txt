ðŸ”¹ 1. Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)
Used for cycle detection, middle node, or k-th node problems.

Problems:

âœ… Find Middle of Linked List

âœ… Detect Cycle in a Linked List (Floydâ€™s Algorithm)

âœ… Find the Start of the Cycle

âœ… Linked List Cycle II

âœ… Check if Palindrome

ðŸ”¹ 2. Reversal Pattern
Reverse the entire list or a part of it.

Problems:

âœ… Reverse a Linked List

âœ… Reverse a Sublist (Between m and n)

âœ… Reverse K Nodes in Groups (e.g., LeetCode 25)

âœ… Palindrome Linked List (with reverse second half)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Pointer Manipulation (In-Place Rearrangement)
Manipulate .next pointers for reordering.

Problems:

âœ… Reorder List (1st â†’ last â†’ 2nd â†’ 2nd last â€¦)

âœ… Odd Even Linked List

âœ… Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

âœ… Swap Nodes in Pairs

âœ… Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups

ðŸ”¹ 4. Cycle Detection and Removal
Detect and remove cycles.

Problems:

âœ… Linked List Cycle

âœ… Remove Cycle from Linked List

âœ… Find Intersection Node of Two Lists (Linked list merge point)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Merge/Sort Linked Lists
Handle multiple sorted linked lists or sorting operations.

Problems:

âœ… Merge Two Sorted Lists

âœ… Merge K Sorted Lists

âœ… Sort a Linked List (Merge Sort)

âœ… Add Two Numbers (Linked list as reversed digits)

ðŸ”¹ 6. Dummy Node Technique
Use dummy head nodes to simplify edge cases.

Problems:

âœ… Remove N-th Node from End

âœ… Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

âœ… Partition List around value x

ðŸ”¹ 7. Linked List to Stack / Array Conversion
Use extra data structures for convenience or constraints.

Problems:

âœ… Next Greater Node in Linked List

âœ… Palindrome Linked List (convert to array or use stack)

âœ… Copy List with Random Pointer

ðŸ§  Tips to Master Linked List Problems:
Practice pointer manipulations on paper or whiteboard.

Always draw out how the .next changes step by step.

Use dummy nodes to simplify boundary cases.

For cycle problems, Floyd's algorithm is your best friend.
